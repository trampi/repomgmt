This is a nice and easy to use webinterface to manage gitolite.

== Under development.
Even if it was developed with care i can not yet assure that it is ready for anything else than a preview.
At the moment the only language supported is german. No testsuite is provided yet.

== Initial steps
* {install gitolite}[http://gitolite.com/gitolite/setup.html]
* clone the gitolite admin repository for later use
* edit .gitolite.rc of the gitolite user. search "UMASK => 0077," and replace it with "UMASK => 0007,"
* chmod 770 /home/gitolite/repositories
* install ruby 1.9.3 (others versions not yet tested)
* install rails 4.1
* add the user under which the application will run to the gitolite group
* clone repomgmt
* configure the application (See in config/application.rb on the bottom)
* register as a new user and use sqlite to grant it the admin privilege (it is on my todo-list...)
* (optionally) you are admin now and can register new users. you can disable registration if you like.
* set git username and email for the repomgmt user in the cloned gitolite admin repository
  * git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  * git config --global user.name "Your Name"
* enjoy it

=== Close registration
Look in app/models/user.rb and remove ":registerable, " around line 19.

=== Sub Uri deployment
* export RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/repomgmt
* rake tmp:cache:clear
